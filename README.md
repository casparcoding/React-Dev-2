# React-Dev-2

Daniel Mburu

Why are you receiving this invite?

Hi there,

My name is Vincent and I’m co-founder at Caspar Coding, a Dutch company that is working with African tech talent. In January 2019, ten of our best senior Kenyan Javascript developers (React and Node) are coming to the Netherlands for a period of three years. As part of their company building program we’re looking for companies (hosts) that are interested to work with them for the full three year period. 

Duration: 3 years

Price: EUR 7.000 p/m

Start date: beginning of January 2019

We’ve added a challenge that they’ve worked on so you can see their skill set and decide whether you’re interested to explore a collaboration further. 

In case you like the quality of the work and you want to discuss this opportunity in more detail please email me vincent.wijdeveld@casparcoding.com or call / text (or whatsapp) +31639397716. 

Yours sincerely,

Vincent Wijdeveld

Co-founder
